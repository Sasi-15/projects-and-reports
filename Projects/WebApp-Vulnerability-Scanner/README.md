# 🛡️ Web Application Vulnerability Scanner

This project is a custom-built Python-based web vulnerability scanner that detects common web application flaws such as:

- ❌ Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- ❌ SQL Injection (SQLi)
- ❌ Form field reflection vulnerabilities

It was developed as part of the **Elevate Labs Internship – Project Phase** to simulate real-world offensive cybersecurity scanning.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

To develop a basic yet effective vulnerability scanner that:
- Accepts a URL as input
- Parses all forms on the page
- Injects XSS and SQLi payloads
- Detects and reports reflected vulnerabilities in responses

## ⚙️ Tools & Libraries Used

| Tool / Lib        | Purpose                        |
|-------------------|--------------------------------|
| Python            | Core language                  |
| `requests`        | Sending GET/POST requests      |
| `BeautifulSoup`   | HTML parsing and form scraping |
| Payloads (text)   | Manual XSS & SQLi injections   |

## 🧪 How It Works

1. Takes a URL input (example: `http://testphp.vulnweb.com`)
2. Extracts all `<form>` tags using BeautifulSoup
3. Submits both XSS and SQLi payloads in every input field
4. Scans the HTTP response for reflected payloads
5. Logs vulnerabilities in `results/scan-report.txt`

---

## 🖥️ Sample Usage

```bash
$ python scanner.py
Enter target URL: http://testphp.vulnweb.com

[+] Found 3 forms on the page.
[Form 1]
[!] Possible SQLi vulnerability with payload: ' OR 1=1 --
[!] Possible XSS vulnerability with payload: <script>alert('XSS')</script>

✅ Scan complete. Results saved to results/scan-report.txt

---

'''🚀 What Makes It Special?
✔️ Customizable payloads

✔️ Simple & extensible architecture

✔️ Fully offline — no external APIs used

✔️ Simulates real-world scanning logic

📌 Final Note
This scanner is built for educational and ethical testing purposes only.
Use it only on authorized targets like test labs or intentionally vulnerable sites.
